## Emoticon Selector
Also known as Jenpa's Faces of Doom.

For several years, I've kept a document of emoticons to select from when I wanted to express my emotions over the internet. It takes a while to open up the doc, find the emoticon I want, select, copy, and paste. This extension saves some of the hassle.

### Use
Find Emoticon Selector in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emoticon-selector/jekhokceghfgglclkjmohaikpgkbdbhj)!
